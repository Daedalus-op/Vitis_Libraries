   :maxdepth: 1

2023.2
------

In this release, we add two API running on AI Engine

* Singular value decomposition, for complex float matrix input
* Pseudoinverse, for complex float matrix input

2023.1
------

In this release, we add two API running on AI Engine.

* QRF (QR decomposition), for float / complex float matrix input
* Cholesky decomposition, for complex float matrix input

2022.1
------

In this relese, we migrate legacy API from Vivado_HLS to solver library. They're all hls::stream based API and support std::complex type.

* Cholesky
* Cholesky Inverse
* QR Inverse
* QRF (QR decomposition)
* SVD
